# YouTube Channel Data Extractor

This Python script extracts data from YouTube channels based on specified keywords and regions. It uses the YouTube Data API v3 to search for channels and scrape additional information from their "About" page.

* Keyword-based search:  Find channels related to specific keywords (e.g., gaming, music, education).
* Region filtering:  Filter channels by region (e.g., US, UK, FR).
* Data extraction:  Extracts the following information:
    * Channel ID
    * Channel title
    * Subscriber count
    * YouTube handle (custom URL)
    * Email address (if available)
    * Discord link (if available)
    * Twitter handle (if available)
* Pagination:  Fetches multiple pages of results.
* API key management:  Uses a list of API keys to handle quota limits.
* Progress saving:  Saves the current progress to resume the extraction later.
