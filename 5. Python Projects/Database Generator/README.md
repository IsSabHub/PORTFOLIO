Data Entry Form
This is a Python program that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for entering and saving user and course information.

Requirements
To run this program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need to install the tkinter module, which is included in Python's standard library. No other external libraries are required.

Running the Program
To run the program, simply execute the data_entry_form.py file in a Python environment.

python data_entry_form.py
The program will launch a GUI window where you can enter user and course information. Once you have entered the required information, click the "Enter data" button to save the data.

User Interface
The user interface of the program is divided into three main sections: user information, course information, and terms and conditions.

User Information
The user information section includes fields for entering the user's first name, last name, title, age, and nationality. The "Title" field is a drop-down list of options (Mr., Ms., Dr., etc.), and the "Nationality" field is a drop-down list of countries. All fields are required.

Course Information
The course information section includes fields for entering the user's registration status, number of completed courses, and number of semesters. The "Registration Status" field is a checkbox that lets you indicate whether the user is currently registered or not. The other fields are spinboxes where you can enter numeric values.

Terms and Conditions
The terms and conditions section includes a single checkbox that you must check to indicate that you accept the program's terms and conditions.

Enter Data Button
Once you have entered all the required information and accepted the terms and conditions, click the "Enter data" button to save the data. If you have not entered all the required information or have not accepted the terms and conditions, an error message will be displayed.
